## 1. AEROPRESS

A versatile tool for brewing coffee. There are countless recipes for the aeropress which you can find on the "Aeromatic" app (recommended by Adelle).  

Your aeropress comes with a chamber, a plunger, several filters, and a cap. If you find that this guide is not enough, there are plenty of videos to get you started. You also can invite me over or come to the house and I will walk you through things. I am very unemployed so I have plenty of time.  

Below, I give you an easy starter-recipe for a cup of black coffee. Continue reading for more details on the remaining items in the kit.  

### Your First Recipe (w/ full detail)

1. Prep your water:
- add some water (bottled/filtered is best) to the kettle and begin heating to 185F. complete steps 2 and 3 while you wait.

2. Prep your aeropress:
- wet your paper filter and smooth it out on the cap. get the filter as flush as possible with the inside edges of the cap. the small rectangular holes will be uncovered and that's okay.
- screw the chamber onto cap. if the filter gets a small bubble, that's okay. if the filter folds anywhere, remove the cap and try again. you need a proper seal on the edges to prevent grounds from getting into your brew.
- keep the plunger nearby.

3. Prep your beans:
- measure 15g of beans into a small bowl
- wet the finger of your choice and stir the beans around. this helps prevent the grounds from building up static and sticking to both the grinder and the aeropress. your finger need not be very wet. too much water is not good for the grinder.
- transfer the lightly-damped beans to the grinder and grind them.
- add your grounds to the prepped aeropress.

4. Brew your coffee:
- pour 220g of the heated water over the grounds. aim for 185-195F. i brew at 185 because i don't like having to wait for the coffee to cool down. adelle brews at 190 because she is an animal and can drink boiling water without burning her mouth. you'll find what works for you, but don't go out of this range to start because it the taste of the coffee will suffer.
- water will be dripping through the holes in the cap. to stop this, you will create a seal. place the plunger into the chamber at a slight angle and pull up the lower side to level out the plunger. if you pull too high, you will displace the filter and find grounds in your coffee. if that happens, just let the coffee brew. you can refilter it once you're done.
- once the seal is created, start the timer on the scale. at the 1 minute mark, gently swirl the aeropress until the layer of beans at the top fully mixes with the water and leave for 2 minutes.
- at the 3 minute mark, swirl once more and gently press the plunger until only grounds remain in the chamber.
- give your coffee one final stir and enjoy!

### Your First Recipe (summarized)

1. heat your water to 185F
2. add 15g of grounds to aeropress
3. add 220g of water, ensuring that all the grounds are wet
4. create a seal with the plunger. let sit 1 min
5. swirl the brewing coffee. let sit 2 mins
6. press, stir, and enjoy 

## 2. COFFEE GRINDER

**NOTE:** This grinder was cleaned and reassembled, which resulted in a slight miscalibration of how the grind size reads. If you turn the numbered dial completely clockwise, the grind size will be on the number 2 (it should be 0). So if you are reading about grind sizes for different coffee recipes, you will need to add 0.2 to the grind size.
