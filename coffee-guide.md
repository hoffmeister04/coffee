## AEROPRESS

A versatile tool for brewing coffee. There are countless recipes for the aeropress which you can find on the "Aeromatic" app (recommended by Adelle).  

Your aeropress comes with a chamber, a plunger, several filters, and a cap. If you find that this guide is not enough, there are plenty of videos to get you started. You also can invite me over or come to the house and I will walk you through things. I am very unemployed so I have plenty of time.

Below, I give you an easy starter-recipe for a cup of black coffee.

### GRINDER

**NOTE:** This grinder was cleaned and reassembled, which resulted in a slight miscalibration of how the grind size reads. If you turn the numbered dial completely clockwise, the grind size will be on the number 2 (it should be 0). So if you are reading about grind sizes for different coffee recipes, you will need to add 0.2 to the grind size.
