# A COFFEE GUIDE FOR DRAKE

Please enjoy the following guide to getting started with your brand new *used* aeropress. I fell in love with the process of making coffee a couple of years ago, and I hope that you find a similar love for the game. The sensory experience is truly the work of gods. The sound of the beans being measured, the feeling of them in the grinder as you turn the handle, the slide of the plunger as you press the coffee through the filter. I am actually nutting just thinking about it and jealous that you get to do this for the first time.  

Your borrowed coffee kit comes with 5 components:  

1. Aeropress
2. Coffee Grinder [1Zpresso JX-Pro] w/ cleaning brush
3. Beans (whole)
4. Scale
5. Kettle w/ thermometer

## 1. AEROPRESS

A versatile tool for brewing coffee. There are countless recipes for the aeropress which you can find on the "Aeromatic" app (recommended by Adelle).  

Your aeropress comes with a chamber, a plunger, several filters, and a cap. If you find that this guide is not enough, there are plenty of videos to get you started. Or you can come over and I can show you the ropes. I am very unemployed so I have plenty of time.  

Below, I give you an easy starter-recipe for a cup of black coffee. Continue reading past that for more details on the items in the kit.  

### Your First Recipe (w/ full detail)

1. Prep your water:
    - add some water (bottled/filtered is best) to the kettle and begin heating to 185F. complete steps 2 and 3 while you wait.

2. Prep your aeropress:
    - wet your paper filter and smooth it out on the cap. get the filter as flush as possible with the inside edge of the cap. the small rectangular holes will be mostly uncovered.
    - screw the chamber onto cap. if the filter gets a small bubble, that's okay. if the filter folds anywhere, remove the cap and try again. you need a proper seal on the edges to prevent grounds from getting into your brew.
    - place the aeropress over your cup and keep the plunger nearby.  

    > **NOTE:** you should avoid using enameled mugs as your catch vessel. repeated pressing can result in chipping over time. this happened to me on my favorite mug :(. adelle and i use a milk frother cup, but one of the mule mugs that is under the island ABOVE THE AIR FRYER will work if you don't want to risk your mugs.

3. Prep your beans:
    - measure 15g of beans into a small bowl.
    - lightly wet the finger of your choice and stir the beans around (adelle and i call this fingering the beans lol). this helps prevent the grounds from building up static and sticking to both the grinder and the aeropress. your finger need not be very wet. too much water is not good for the grinder.
    - transfer the lightly-damped beans to the grinder and grind them.
    - add your grounds to the prepped aeropress chamber.

4. Brew your coffee:
    - pour 220g of the heated water over the grounds. aim for 185-195F. i brew at 185 because i don't like having to wait for the coffee to cool down. adelle brews at 190 because she is an animal and can drink boiling water without burning her mouth. you'll find what works for you, but don't go out of this range to start because the taste of the coffee will suffer.
    - water will be dripping through the holes in the cap. to stop this, you will create a seal. place the plunger into the chamber at a slight angle and pull up the lower side to level out the plunger. if you pull too high, you will displace the filter and find grounds in your coffee. if that happens, just let the coffee brew. you can refilter it once you're done.
    - once the seal is created, start the timer on the scale. the timer counts up. at the 1 minute mark, gently swirl the aeropress until the layer of beans at the top fully mixes with the water and leave for 2 minutes.
    - at the 3 minute mark, swirl once more and slowly press the plunger down until only grounds remain in the chamber.
    - give your coffee one final stir and enjoy!

### Your First Recipe (summarized)

1. heat your water to 185F
2. finger 15g of beans
3. add grounds to aeropress
4. add 220g of water, ensuring that all the grounds are wet
5. create a seal with the plunger. let sit 1 min
6. swirl the brewing coffee. let sit 2 mins
7. press, stir, and enjoy :)  

### Care and Best Practices

#### Cleaning

Very straightforward. Rinse and clear off any grounds between uses at the very least. Do NOT put the grounds down the drain. They make a great addition to compost, but since you guys don't do that I guess you can just put them in the trash [*insert dramatic sigh*].  

The black rubber piece on the plunger comes off for cleaning/drying. The version of the aeropress you currently have is somewhat annoying to put the rubber piece back on. You can leave it on for daily washes if you want. Take it off at least once a week or if you don't plan on using the aeropress for a while. This will allow for proper drying.  

#### Filters

These are in the black plastic case. A single filter will last you weeks depending on how much coffee you are making. You will know that you need a fresh filter when pressing the coffee becomes difficult, or if you are finding excessive grounds in your coffee despite proper brewing practices.  

If a filter tears, toss it and replace it. If you run out, let me know. We have lots of filters.  

#### BONUS: Cap

If you are enjoying making coffee with the aeropress and want to get into espresso drinks, I recommend purchasing a different cap. Specifically the aeropress flow control filter cap. This cap is superior because it holds your brew until you want to filter it. You don't have to create a seal with the plunger or attempt the crazy inverted brew methods you might come across. This alternate cap also makes it easier to brew multiple cups of coffe in a single round. Adelle and I use this cap every day.

## 2. COFFEE GRINDER

> **NOTE:** This grinder was cleaned and reassembled, which resulted in a slight miscalibration of how the grind size reads. If you turn the numbered dial completely clockwise, the grind size will be on the number 2 (it should be 0). So if you are reading about grind sizes or referring to the chart for the grinder, you will need to add 0.2 to the grind size on your grinder.  

### Grind Size

**Current Setting:** 3.0 (shows as 3.2)  

One of the most important things to consider when "dialing in" your coffee is the size of your grind. You can learn about this through James Hoffmann or various other sources in the online coffee world. Ultimately, your own tastes will decide what is good.  

The grind sizes for the JX-Pro (the grinder in your kit) are understood as follows:
- The larger the number, the larger the grind size.
- To reach the closed position, turn the dial clockwise until it stops. As mentioned in the note above, the red dot will be on the number 2, but you should consider this to be 0.
- The whole number is total number of counter-clockwise rotations from the closed position.
- The decimals are represented by the numbers on the dial after full rotations. Each decimal number has 4 clicks, represented by the silver dots between each number.
- When looking at the chart, the number "24" represents 2 full counter-clockwise rotations from the closed position + counter-clockwise rotation to the number 4.

Generally, smaller grind sizes are used for faster brewing methods. Espresso uses very fine grounds, while drip coffee uses more coarse grounds. For the recipe I gave you, staying around 3.0-3.4 (3.2-3.6 on your grinder) will suffice at first.  

The easiest way to test what grind size you like is to make a cup at any grind size and note how it tastes. Then make your next cup the same way, changing the grind size by 0.4 in either direction. Below is a chart for the grinder that shows a starting point for most brew methods. The aeropress is in the yellow block.

### Care and Best Practices

#### When to clean out the grinder:

> **NEVER** use a wet brush or any water to the clean the grinder. You will destroy it. Water = BAD.

You should always brush out the grinder after changing the grind size or when grinding a different roast than your previous grind. This isn't for the grinder as much as it is for the taste of your coffee. Mixing grind sizes and bean types doesn't result in the tastiest cup of coffee.  

Don't bother with deep cleaning it. Just the occasional dry brush will be fine.

## 3. BEANS

By far the most important thing to consider for good coffee. The coffee you currently drink is likely nasty ass burnt bean water sourced unethically (offense intended). Aim for a more ethical and tasty bean water. Any bean that goes directly from grower to roaster has a higher chance of being not shit in a myriad of ways.  

The particular roast I left you was my go-to for months. If you are not going to get into the aeropress in the next couple of weeks, give them back to me. They get stale and degrade in taste over time. I will get you a fresh roast when you are ready.  

When you buy your own beans, I *BEG* of you, do not buy from the grocery store. You can find beans at almost any coffee shop and there are plenty of local roasters in Columbus. Aim for something that is fair trade. It's hard to know which sellers respect their growers, but small batch roasters tend to take care in their craft and are more likely to respect their suppliers and the environment from which their beans come.

## 4. SCALE

Weighs beans and water really goodly. Has fresh batteries. Has a built-in timer. You have used a scale lol.  

--- 

## 5. KETTLE

You don't *HAVE* to use the kettle I left. It's as accurate as you can get with measuring temperature, which is why I left it for you. We have a gas stove which caused the bottom to bubble a bit, so it wobbles slightly on your stove top as it heats. Slightly annoying, but it gets the job done.
